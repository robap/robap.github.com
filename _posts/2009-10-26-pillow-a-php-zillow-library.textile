title: Pillow - A PHP Zillow Library
tags: PHP, Zillow
---

For those familiar with the "zillow api network":http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm, getting started may seem a daunting task. I’ve recently published "pillow":http://github.com/robap/pillow – a library aimed at making php development with zillow easier.

h4. Get a Zillow Web Services Id

If you haven’t done so already, get your "Zillow web services Id here":http://www.zillow.com/webservice/Registration.htm.

h4. Download and Extract Pillow

# Get the latest "tarball":http://github.com/robap/pillow/tarball/master or "zipfile":http://github.com/robap/pillow/zipball/master
# Extract.

{% highlight bash %}
  wget http://github.com/robap/pillow/tarball/master
  tar -zxvf robap-pillow-3cc404a.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

h4. Set UP a Test File

{% highlight php %}
//save as test_pillow.php
require '/path/to/pillow/lib/pillow.php';

$zws_id = 'your zws id';

$factory = new Pillow_Factory( $zws_id );

$address = '1405 W Golf Course Rd';
$csz = 'midland, tx';

$property = $factory->findExactProperty($address, $csz, TRUE);

print_r($property);
{% endhighlight %}

h4. Run It

{% highlight bash %}
php test_pillow.php
{% endhighlight %}

You should see the returned Pillow_Property object and all of the object properties you can access. The Pillow_Property object has methods available to get comps and charts. Future versions of Pillow will contain methods for all of Zillow’s api calls.
