I recently had to build a new development system. I wanted to document the hardware I chose since I am running Ubuntu and was not sure if my hardware choices would work.

|_. Description |_. Product |_. Price |
| Motherboard | Micro ATX w/AM3 CPU socket MSI GF615-P31 $54.99 – $10.00 mail-in rebate | $44.99 |
| CPU | AMD Athlon II Dual-cor 3.1GHz | $61.99 |
| Memory | 2GB DDR3 | $27.99 |
| Case | Cooler Master Elite 343 | $39.99 |
| Power Supply | Cooler Master Extreme Power 460w | $39.99 |
| HDD | Seagate 1TB Serial ATA HD | $59.99 |
| Video Card | NVIDIA GeForce EVGA 210 $49.99 – $30.00 mail-in rebate | $19.99 |
| Monitor | Viewsonic VX2450WM-LED 24-Inch | $179.99 |
| OS | Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit | $0.00 |
| | | $474.92 |

The additional video card was not really necessary since the motherboard has one onboard. I chose to get one so that I could at some point support two monitors. I haven’t done this yet but will report on my results when I do. I did mail in and actually receive the rebates for the motherboard and video card. I already had a keyboard and mouse. Since I installed Ubuntu from a usb flash drive, I did not need a cd/dvd drive.

While this hardware configuration is not the best or fastest, I am very happy with it’s performance as a web development system.
